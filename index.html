                I’m a beginner developer with experience across a few different languages and platforms. I primarily work with Java, focusing on Spigot MC development for creating custom Minecraft server plugins and features. I also have experience with C++, which I picked up during Indonesian National Science Olympiad (OSN) training, as well as Python, which I use to create animations with Manim. Additionally, I work with JavaScript for backend web development. I enjoy challenging myself and continually learning, which is why I’ve explored areas like CTF (Capture the Flag) to expand my problem-solving skills and deepen my knowledge of security.

                I Draw
            </h1>
            <h2 class="desc-r">
                I’ve always loved drawing, and I’m a traditional artist at heart—pen and paper all the way. I’ve filled more than 50 notebooks with comics over the years, most of which are casual or comedic in nature. But now, I’m focused on my main project, Eternal Collapse. It’s a psychological horror, drama, medieval fantasy series that blends action, mystery, and deep storytelling. This project is a big part of my creative journey, and I’m putting everything into developing the plot and characters. Creating comics is one of my favorite ways to express ideas, and I’m excited to continue building Eternal Collapse into something special. The image next to this is one of the characters from Eternal Collapse.

                I Animate
            </h1>
            <h2 class="desc-l">
                Animation is another area I’m passionate about. I create Minecraft animations using Mine-imator, a tool that lets me turn ideas into animated content within the Minecraft universe. While I’m still refining my skills, I find the creative process really fulfilling. My animations are a fun way to experiment and develop my abilities, and I share my progress on YouTube for anyone who’s interested in checking it out. I’m excited to keep improving and exploring new ways to tell stories through animation.
